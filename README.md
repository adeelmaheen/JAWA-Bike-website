2. **Open `index.html`**: Use a web browser to open the `index.html` file or serve it via a local server (e.g., using `Live Server` in VS Code).
3. **Dependencies**:
   - The website uses an external CDN for Remixicon (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@3.4.0/fonts/remixicon.css`).
   - Ensure an internet connection to load this resource, or host it locally if needed.

## Notes
- The website assumes the presence of a `styles.css` file for styling. Ensure this file is properly linked and implemented.
